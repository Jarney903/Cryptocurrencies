# Cryptocurrencies
Module #18 Unsupervised Machine Learning

## Purpose
Create an analysis for your clients who are preparing to get into the cryptocurrency market.  Rrocessed data to fit the machine learning models. Since there is no known output, use unsupervised learning. To group the cryptocurrencies, a clustering algorithm will be used. Include data visualizations to share findings with the board.

Deliverable 1: Preprocessing the Data for PCA
Deliverable 2: Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
Deliverable 3: Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
Deliverable 4: Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results
